		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>MIND Research Institute is an educational non-profit that has served millions of students over the last 22 years, but the brand was beginning to show its age. An old logotype and outdated website were the biggest offenders. Brand confusion was a major issue, and we needed MIND to be recognized as a thought leader in the EdTech industry apart from just our flagship product (ST Math).</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We started with a new logo. A modern, geometric icon with a clean word mark to bring MIND into the 21st century. From there, we built out brand colors & patterns. We put it all together in a complete redesign of the company's website.</p>
