		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Co-Op Critics is a blog, podcast, and YouTube channel dedicated to gaming. We needed a brand that was eye-catching&mdash;one that would stand out among the crowded world of YouTube gaming channels. The website needed to be a central HUB where users could easily access the most recent content&mdash;whether that's videos, podcasts, or news.</p>

	<div class="solution">
		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>I chose to use bright, primary colors for the brand. Having multiple accent colors allows for the use of a different color depending on the content (video, podcast, blog). The logo is a simple, flat icon that is recognizable even when used at smaller sizes (watermarks, social media profile images, etc.). The website homepage allows direct access to the most recent content right at the top of the page.</p>
