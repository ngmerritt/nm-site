		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Kitbash is a small shop that produces big work. We needed a brand and website that would help us compete with the heavyweights in the industry. The word "kitbash" means to take pieces and parts from several different models and combine them to create something custom and unique. We wanted that uniqueness to resonate throughout the brand.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We chose a logo that is made up of simple geometric shapes. This continues the theme of assembling something from several smaller parts. The color blue, images of factories and tools, and some of the copywriting are also used to convey a hard-working / blue-collar theme.</p>

<p>During the logo design process, our team came up with dozens of concepts and hundreds of variations. Below is a small section of one of my working files along with some of my favorite marks.</p>
