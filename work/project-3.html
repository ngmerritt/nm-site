		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>South of the Sahara is a set of storybook board games that combine math, history, and literacy in a highly connected experience. This was the first time we would be packaging and marketing board games under the MathMINDs Games brand. We also needed to take into account that the packaging design would be the first in a series. A landing page was also needed as a way to offer more info and generate sales.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We chose to lean heavily on the amazing storybook illustrations that were created with the help of our contract artist. This gave us freedom to "frame" the key art with simple design elements as a way of adding consistency in future releases. The landing page also takes full advantage of the artwork and motion to draw the user deeper into the story.</p>

<p>During the logo design process, our team came up with dozens of concepts and hundreds of variations. Below is a small section of one of my working files along with some of my favorite marks.</p>
