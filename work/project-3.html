		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>South of the Sahara is a set of storybook board games that combine math, history, and literacy in a highly connected experience. This was the first time we would be packaging and marketing board games under the MathMINDs Games brand. We also needed to take into account that the packaging design would be the first in a series. A landing page was also needed as a way to offer more info and generate sales.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We chose to lean heavily on the amazing storybook illustrations that were created with the help of our contract artist. This gave us freedom to "frame" the key art with simple design elements as a way of adding consistency in future releases. The landing page also takes full advantage of the artwork and motion to draw the user deeper into the story.</p>

<p>Working closely with the game designer and illustrator, we were able to bring the same beauty and life from the storybooks into the landing page. We used a parallax scrolling effect to add even more depth to the illustrations. The "Behind the Games" section offers a deeper dive into the games and their development. This was a large effort spanning multiple departments and contracted services for illustration, videography, and development.</p>
