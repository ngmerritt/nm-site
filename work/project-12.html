<p>When I first started at MIND Research Institute, we made the decision to lean more heavily into video content. Being a non-profit meant shoestring budgets and the need to do most editing and motion graphics in-house. I took this opportunity to dive in and learn new skills. Above, you can watch a small selection of educational videos I animated and below, you can find a couple of logo reveals. I also worked with a contract videographer to provide direction and all art assets including intros, outros, title cards, and animated lower thirds.</p>

<p>Here are some digital paintings I've done in my free time. I wish I had time to do more. I really enjoy it.</p>

<p>Some scratchy sketches of random things. Sometimes it's nice to sketch more than just wireframes!</p>
