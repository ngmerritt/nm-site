		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Triumph Bank wanted a complete rebrand. Their old site was outdated and was full of redundancies. The new brand would place an emphasis on growth and community, while the website would increase usability. They also needed a consistent look across both their banking and mortgage sites.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>After our team reworked the logo, I worked as lead designer on their new website. We did a complete overhaul, streamlining the user experience and visual design. In addition to the website, we created an entire new identity package to reflect their new brand.</p>

<p>In addition to the main website, we built the My Triumph microsite to pair with the ad campaign. This gave us a way to showcase the "stories" of Triumph customers.</p>
