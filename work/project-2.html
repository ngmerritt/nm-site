		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>The ST Math program serving over 1.3 million students was getting a much-needed facelift. The updated games promised cleaner design, improved functionality, new cutting-edge features. We wanted to give the brand and mascot (JiJi) a refresh to celebrate the launch of the new ST Math. But how do you make improvements to a character that is beloved by over a million students without losing what makes JiJi special?</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We worked collaboratively across multiple creative teams over the course of a couple of months. After countless iterations, we solicited feedback from students and teachers. This version of JiJi would be the face of the new ST Math. Improved, yet familiar. Along with the new logo, we refreshed the entire brand including the website, ads, collateral, and event graphics.</p>
