		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>The ST Math program serving over 1.3 million students was getting a much-needed facelift. The updated games promised cleaner design, improved functionality, new cutting-edge features. We wanted to give the brand and mascot (JiJi) a refresh to celebrate the launch of the new ST Math. But how do you make improvements to a character that is beloved by over a million students without losing what makes JiJi special?</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We worked collaboratively across multiple creative teams over the course of a couple of months. After countless iterations, we solicited feedback from students and teachers. This version of JiJi would be the face of the new ST Math. Improved, yet familiar. Along with the new logo, we refreshed the entire brand including the website, ads, collateral, and event graphics.</p>

<p>We started by putting together a "JiJi Team" consisting of my marketing design team, design leads from the product team, and several contract illustrators. Our first weekly meeting was to establish the traits that made JiJi unique. Our following meetings were then dedicated to submitting concept sketches, review, and discussion. Once we had a clear direction, we tightened that feedback loop so that we were seeing progress in each iteration.</p>
<p>Although the product design team had already created an improved version of JiJi to be used in-game, this process revealed a lot about our feathered friend. And most of the changes we made for the trademarked version of JiJi would eventually make their way into the game as well. Look below for a sample of just some of the sketches provided by our talented team.</p>

<p>The ST Math website had passed its two year launch anniversary. Over those two years the amount of content had grown by 400%. We had a lot of work to do from an information architecture standpoint. To get the most out of so much new content, we needed a clearer path for the user.</p>
<p>We decided to give the user the option to select their "role" from the start. This could guide them to a landing page with aggregated content based on their needs. This also offered us a way to track how those "roles" were navigating our website. What offers were they downloading? Which blogs were they reading?</p>
<p>We also added cross-domain search functionality to give users quicker access to keywords they were looking for. This allowed the search of all pages across ST Math and MIND sites, including all blog posts.</p>
<p>All of this combines to improve the user experience from first touch, all the way through to the games themselves.</p>
<p class="alert">This case study will be expanding soon to include more artifacts and a deeper dive into the process.</p>
