<p>At MIND Research Institute, I led the team responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining multiple online products. In addition to our company site (mindresearch.org) and our flagship product site (stmath.com), we created dozens of other experiences. Here is a showcase of just some of the additional online products I helped craft at MIND.</p>

<h3>Annual Report</h3>
<p>Every year, my team works closely with other departments in the organization to create MIND's annual report. In 2018, I led a redesign of the annual report to improve the donor experience. My goal was to build a more scaleable system that would enable others to reuse modules in future versions. In 2019, I handed over lead design duties to a senior member on my team while I art directed the project.</p>

<h3>Conversation Tool</h3>
<p>I was tasked with replacing an old, outdated sales tool. The original tool was built in Flash, was difficult to maintain, and could only be accessed from a direct install on company iPads. How would our team rebuild this tool without help from our engineers?</p>
<p>After a lot of research, I decided to use RevealJS (Slides.com) as the framework for the new conversation tool. It was accessible from any device, allowed us to embed ST Math games directly into the tool, and Slides.com made it easy to update and maintain.</p>

<h3>Brand Guidelines</h3>
<p>My team created and maintained the Brand Guidelines for MIND and ST Math. By creating an online version, we were able to easily share brand colors, typography, logo usage, and downloads.</p>

<h3>Email Signature Generator</h3>
<p>We needed all employees to have custom email signatures with approved branding and formatting. But with over 150 employees and only two designers at the time, it was too much to ask for us to hand make them. So, I decided to create a tool so they could make their own.</p>
<p>I built the email signature generator in HTML/CSS/JS. It includes the option for a MIND or ST Math branded signature. Did I mention they needed versions for Outlook, Mail, HubSpot, and NetSuite? This meant that employees needed to be able to copy their signature visually, and in HTML format. To make sure we stay under Netsuite's character limit, I also built in the ability to copy the minified HTML.</p>
<p>It takes rigorous testing and iterations to make a design look the same in all major email clients. This tool has saved our team so much valuable time over the past 3 years.</p>

<h3>MIND Marketplace</h3>
<p>We chose to use Shopify to update and improve our marketplace experience. Our store includes access to JiJi branded swag, MathMINDs board games, and ST Math Homeschool.</p>

<h3>Holiday Landing Pages</h3>
<p>Each year, our team created a Holiday landing page and illustrated e-card. This always offered a fun way for employees, donors, and ST Math users to wish others a Happy Holiday while celebrating MIND.</p>
