<p>At MIND Research Institute, I led the team responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining multiple online products. In addition to our company site (mindresearch.org) and our flagship product site (stmath.com), we created dozens of other experiences. Here is a showcase of just some of the additional online products I helped craft at MIND.</p>

<h3>Annual Report</h3>
<p>Every year, my team works closely with other departments in the organization to create MIND's annual report. In 2018, I led a redesign of the annual report to improve the donor experience. My goal was to build a more scaleable system that would enable others to reuse modules in future versions. In 2019, I handed over lead design duties to a senior member on my team while I art directed the project.</p>

<h3>Conversation Tool</h3>
<p>I was tasked with replacing an old, outdated sales tool. The original tool was built in Flash, was difficult to maintain, and could only be accessed from a direct install on company iPads. How would our team rebuild this tool without help from our engineers?</p>
<p>After a lot of research, I decided to use RevealJS (Slides.com) as the framework for the new conversation tool. It was accessible from any device, allowed us to embed ST Math games directly into the tool, and Slides.com made it easy to update and maintain.</p>

<h3>Holiday Landing Pages</h3>
<p>Here are some digital paintings I've done in my free time. I wish I had time to do more. I really enjoy it.</p>

<p>Some scratchy sketches of random things. Sometimes it's nice to sketch more than just wireframes!</p>
