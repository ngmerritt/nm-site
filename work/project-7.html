<h3>Print Design</h3>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the new ST Math brand, we created new swag. We also worked closely with our local print shop to create a custom folder with a diagonal fold and semi-circle closure for both MIND and ST Math.</p>

<h3>New JiJi Mascot Design</h3>
<p>The 1st generation of JiJi mascots were an outdated design, expensive to ship to events and schools, and made it difficult for a performer to see and move. Our goal was to create a new design that matched our new and improved JiJi brand while also addressing these pain points. </p>

<p>Our team worked very closely with our vendor to solve these problems. It took a lot of planning and iterations to get the character dimensions right. We chose materials that were lightweight, breathable, and more durable. We chose to add a fan ventilation system into the mascot, hidden at the crown of the head to be invisible to children. And lastly we chose a structure that condenses down to half the size of previous mascots for shipping, saving the company a lot of money when sending the mascots across the country to events and schools.</p>

<h3>Event Graphics</h3>
<p>In order to show off our updated branding and the newest version of ST Math, we overhauled our booth designs for both regional and national events. We chose a lit-from-within wall design to help us stand out at crowded events. We incorporated a TV mount and two podiums that could be used for product demos. In addition, our team created informational video loops, interactive product demos, interactive sales tools, and all print collateral and swag.</p>
