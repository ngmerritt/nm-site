	<div class="problem">
		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Triumph was looking to update their brand to reflect their focus on growth and community. They also needed an improved user experience and a consistent look and feel for their banking and mortgage sites. (2016)</p>
	</div>
	<div class="solution">
		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>Our team provided brand and identity packages, website redesign, and copywriting. I led our UX initiatives as we reworked the information architecture to allow for the mortgage and banking sites to be merged. We focused on removing redundancies, addressing pain points, and streamlining the overall user experience.</p>

<p class="caption">Our team also provided ongoing advertising design for print, digital, out-of-home, and events.</p>
<p>In addition to the main website, we built the My Triumph microsite to pair with the ad campaign. This gave us a way to showcase the "stories" of Triumph customers.</p>
