		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>As a designer, I'm always evolving, learning new skills, and changing my visual style. I wanted a website that would better reflect who I am as a designer. First and foremost the site needed to be usable&mdash;not just something pretty to look at. It also needed to be flexible in terms of how I showcase my work.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>I decided to go with a single page site to keep navigation simple. I use AJAX to dynamically load the case studies in the work section. This allows the user to view case studies without leaving the homepage. Go ahead...scroll down. See, I told you. I thought it would be fun to show some of the different iterations throughout the process below.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these prototypes are not what the site looks like now. I actually built the site you see in the prototypes in its entirety. But it didn't feel right. In my effort to make the entire site feel like a mobile app, I sucked all the personality out of it. This is when I decided to go back to the drawing board. But I had the skeleton of the site already built, so I used it to help me rapid prototype some new ideas directly to HTML/CSS. The sketches above show a small turning point where I jumped from the original idea to the path that led me here.</p>
