<h3>Print Design</h3>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the new ST Math brand, we created new swag. We also worked closely with our local print shop to create a custom folder with a diagonal fold and semi-circle closure for both MIND and ST Math.</p>

<h3>New JiJi Mascot Design</h3>
<p>Our team worked closely with our vendor to create a new mascot design that more closely resembled the new and improved JiJi. This took a lot of planning and iterations to get the dimensions right. Now our JiJi mascots are lighter, more durable, easier to move in</p>

<h3>Event Graphics</h3>
<p>New branding means a new booth. We took the opportunity to update more than just the graphics and opted for a completely new layout and design. Choosing a lit-from-within booth design helped us stand out at crowded events. We also incorporated a TV mount and two podiums for demos.</p>
