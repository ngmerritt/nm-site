		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>I was approached by Fund The Nations to work on the HopeGrid project. They needed a logo, landing page design, and UI design for the web app. HopeGrid is an application that allows churches to search for needs in their area. They can then commit to help meet that need. It needed to be simple and user-friendly to allow for quick access and clear information.</p>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>The logo design is minimalistic and allows the mark to easily be used as an app icon. The landing page is a single page, responsive design to make it easy for users to navigate. The web app UI was designed with a mobile-first approach. It prioritizes the discover and management of "needs".</p>
