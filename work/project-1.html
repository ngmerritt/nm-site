		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>MIND Research Institute is an educational non-profit that has served millions of students over the last 22 years, but the brand was beginning to show its age. An old logotype and outdated website were the biggest offenders. Brand confusion was a major issue, and we needed MIND to be recognized as a thought leader in the EdTech industry apart from just our flagship product (ST Math).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="solution">
		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We started with a new logo. A modern, geometric icon with a clean word mark to bring MIND into the 21st century. From there, we built out brand colors, typography, and patterns. We put it all together in a complete redesign of the company's website.</p>

<h3>A Better Brand</h3>
<p>MIND Research Institute is an educational non-profit that has served millions of students over the last 22 years, but the brand was beginning to show its age. An old logotype and outdated website were the biggest offenders. Brand confusion was a major issue, and we needed MIND to be recognized as a thought leader in the EdTech industry apart from just our flagship product (ST Math).</p>

<p>Re-designing the identity of a 20 year old company is no easy task. A lot of brand equity had been built over the years and we didn't want to take that for granted. We knew this was a delicate process and we would need to be very thoughtful with our decisions.</p>
<p>We put together some focus groups within our organization, including our Leadership Team to gather qualitative data on the existing brand and website designs. A lot of discussion was had, but we came away with three key questions. Who is our audience? What is our identity? What is our purpose? The feedback received in these workshops was critical to making this rebrand a success.</p>
<img src="work/img/mind/mind-04b.jpg">
<p>With these guidelines, I began sketching the initial concepts for a new logomark. We wanted the logomark to be rooted in math and games to mirror MIND's identity and mission. But, it was also important to me that we didn’t use math symbols or any other “cheesy” solutions. After weeks of explorations and internal feedback within my team, we settled on a few strong concepts to present. We presented the new logo concepts to several executive level stakeholders including MIND's founder. There was a clear frontrunner, and after weeks of iterations and a rigorous approval process, the new logo was complete.</p>
<img src="work/img/mind/mind-04b.jpg">
<p>The final mark combines three aspects of MIND – neuroscience, math, and games. The wireframe design is a visual representation of a schema. We visualize schemas as an interconnected web of knowledge where separate subjects are connected by neural pathways.  The geometry of the mark was also derived from an icosahedron. Gamers will know this shape as a D20 die. We experimented with different ways to morph this into the two hemispheres of the brain. All of this comes together to form a stronger brand that differentiates us and embodies the identity of MIND.</p>

<h3>A Better Website</h3>
<p>We worked closely with an outside agency to build a new website that could showcase our award-winning products, research, and thought leadership. Although, the agency would be building the initial site, our team would be responsible for future iterations and maintenance.</p>
