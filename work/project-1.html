		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>MIND Research Institute is an educational non-profit that has served millions of students over the last 22 years, but the brand was beginning to show its age. An old logotype and outdated website were the biggest offenders. Brand confusion was a major issue, and we needed MIND to be recognized as a thought leader in the EdTech industry apart from just our flagship product (ST Math).</p>

	<div class="solution">
		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		<p>We started with a new logo. A modern, geometric icon with a clean word mark to bring MIND into the 21st century. From there, we built out brand colors, typography, and patterns. We put it all together in a complete redesign of the company's website.</p>

<p>Re-designing the identity of a 20 year old company is no easy task. A lot of brand equity had been built over the years and we didn't want to take that for granted. We decided to keep the signature orange accent color as a thread connecting MIND and the ST Math product. We dropped the serifs and softened the corners to bring it into the 21st century.</p>
<p>The mark was derived from an icosahedron. Gamers will know this shape as a D20 die. We experimented with different ways to morph this into the two hemispheres of the brain. We wanted the logomark to be rooted in math and games to mirror MIND's identity and mission.</p>
<img src="work/img/mind/mind-04b.jpg">
<p>We presented the new logo concepts to several executive level stakeholders including MIND's founder. After taking the new logo through this rigorous approval process, our next step was to build out new colors, patterns, typography, and icons. We worked closely with an outside agency to build a new website that could showcase our award-winning products, research, and thought leadership. Although, the agency would be building the initial site, our team would be responsible for future iterations and maintenance.</p>
