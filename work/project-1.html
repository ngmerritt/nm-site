<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>NZXT is known for its Custom PC Configurator (BLD) that lets users hand-select each part for their new computer. So, naturally we wanted to extend that level of customization to new product lines. Our team had a vision for a future family of configurators. A fully connected experience where a user could customize an entire desk of products, moving seamlessly between each configurator. We even built some rough wireframes and prototypes to bring this vision to life. This was used as our North Star when building each new configurator.</p>

<h3>Keyboard & Mouse Configurator</h3>
<p>While our existing PC configurator gave us a starting point in terms of UI elements and design patterns, customizing a keyboard is very different from customizing a PC. We would need a user experience that felt tailored for keyboards.</p>
<p><strong>Market Research</strong><br>We began by doing some competitive analysis and research. Initially, we focused on other keyboard configurators. We then decided to expand that research into ALL configurators. Including products like cars, headphones, office chairs, knives, and guitars to name a few. This research, paired with data from our existing PC configurator, was pivotal in helping our team gain a clearer picture of how users customize any number of products.</p>

<p><strong>User Flows & Wireframes</strong><br>This new research gave us the insight we needed to begin creating user stories and flows. This included mapping out all the many possible points for a user to enter and exit the configurator, as well as saving a build or loading a previous session. </p>

<p>We then built out wireframes and worked closely with our Product and Engineering teams to iterate early and often. This consistent feedback loop kept us flexible as requirements changed and scope fluctuated.</p>

<p><strong>Prototypes</strong><br>My favorite part of the process was getting the opportunity to create some high quality prototypes for proof of concept and testing. I used Figma to craft many interactive prototypes of the keyboard configurator experience for both desktop and mobile. These were invaluable when it came to understanding interaction at different viewport sizes. We could quickly see what would and wouldnâ€™t work. They also helped our Interactive team communicate specific interactions or animations to Engineering.</p>

<h3>BLD Hub</h3>
<p>If our goal was to unify these multiple product configurators into a single experience, we needed a home base for the user to return to. I recommended the addition of a BLD Hub to tie it all together. This would not only act as a starting point for all customizable products, it would also offer the user info on the status of their in-progress or saved builds.</p>
