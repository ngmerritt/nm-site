<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>NZXT is known for its Custom PC Configurator (BLD) that lets users hand-select each part for their new computer. So, naturally we wanted to extend that level of customization to new product lines. Our team had a vision for a future family of configurators. A fully connected experience where a user could customize an entire desk of products, moving seamlessly between each configurator. We even built some rough wireframes and prototypes to bring this vision to life. This was used as our North Star when building each new configurator.</p>

<h3>Keyboard &amp; Mouse Configurator</h3>
<p>While our existing PC configurator gave us a starting point in terms of UI elements and design patterns, customizing a keyboard is very different from customizing a PC. We would need a user experience that felt tailored for keyboards.</p>
<p><strong>Market Research</strong><br>We began by doing some competitive analysis and research. Initially, we focused on other keyboard configurators, but quickly expanded that research into ALL configurators. Including products like cars, headphones, office chairs, knives, and guitars to name a few. This research, paired with data from our existing PC configurator, was pivotal in helping our team gain a clearer picture of how users customize any number of products.</p>
<img src="work/img/nzxt/nzxt-config-research.png" class="no-border">
<p><strong>User Flows &amp; Wireframes</strong><br>This new research gave us the insight we needed to begin creating user stories and flows. This included mapping out all the many possible points for a user to enter and exit the configurator, as well as saving a build or loading a previous session. </p>
<img src="work/img/nzxt/nzxt-user-flow.png" class="no-border">
<p>We then built out wireframes and worked closely with our Product and Engineering teams to iterate early and often. This consistent feedback loop kept us flexible as requirements changed and scope fluctuated.</p>

<p class="caption">Early Wireframes for Keyboard Configurator</p>
<p><strong>Prototypes</strong><br>My favorite part of the process was getting the opportunity to create some high quality prototypes for proof of concept and testing. I used Figma to craft many interactive prototypes of the keyboard configurator experience for both desktop and mobile. These were invaluable when it came to understanding interaction at different viewport sizes. We could quickly see what would and wouldn’t work. They also helped our Interactive team communicate specific interactions or animations to Engineering.</p>

<p class="caption">Figma Prototype for Desktop Flow</p>
<p>Above is an example of one of the dozens of prototypes I made for testing purposes. Using Figma allowed us to rapidly prototype and get quick feedback across all teams. This example is at roughly the midpoint of the project. You can see just how much has changed from this point to production.</p>

<p class="caption">Figma Prototype for Mobile Flow</p>
<p>This mobile example is much closer to production than the previous prototype. But you can still see elements that were left out due to time or technical constraints. Discerning which features are critical and which ones can be removed or added later is a valuable skill to learn.</p>

<h3>BLD Hub</h3>
<p>If our goal was to unify these multiple product configurators into a single experience, we needed a home base for the user to return to. I recommended the addition of a BLD Hub to tie it all together. This would not only act as a starting point for all customizable products, it would also offer the user info on the status of their in-progress or saved builds.</p>

<p>I even built out several working prototypes for the various BLD Hub explorations, including a revamped PC Configurator to match the new visual direction.</p>

</div>
<p>We ultimately settled on a more subtle direction that leaned into the dark mode aesthetic. This felt more visually aligned with our brand, but it also helps declutter the UI and directs the user toward clear CTAs for starting a build or resuming a saved build.</p>

<h3>Handoff &amp; Launch</h3>
<p>A crucial part of the process is handing off approved designs to Engineering. Even though we'd been working in lockstep for months, preparing files for handoff ensures that design requirements are met for all of the many new components introduced in such a large project. I was responsible for providing specs regarding spacing, typography, viewports, and more.</p>

<p class="caption">Figma makes handoff easy.</p>
<p>After many months of research, design, testing, and iteration, we were ready to launch the BLD Hub and Keyboard Configurator experience alongside our new keyboard and mouse products lines. The final product is the result of months of intense collaboration between our Design, Product, and Engineering teams. I’m proud to have led the design for such a key experience on our website.</p>
